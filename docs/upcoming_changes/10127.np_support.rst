Fix IndexError in ``np.ndenumerate`` for zero-dimensional arrays
----------------------------------------------------------------

Fix ``IndexError`` that occurred when using ``np.ndenumerate()`` on zero-dimensional
arrays in numba-compiled functions. The issue was caused by ``pack_array`` being
called with an empty list when ``ndim=0``. Fixed by providing explicit type
parameters to ``pack_array`` calls in the flattening iterator implementation.
